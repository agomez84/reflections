When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I need to collaborate or share with somebody
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because that way I can choose when and how to update changes in GitHub, and therefore share with others
