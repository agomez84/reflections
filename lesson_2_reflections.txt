What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates the .git folder and starts tracking changes via commits, as far as you save them.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It is different because it allows to select several and not necessarily all the files, to work with them in a single commit. It offers a great value since you can kind of isolate some files in order to do modifications, and track them easily.
